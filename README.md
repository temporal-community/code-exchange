# Temporal Code Exchange

Welcome to Temporal's Code Exchange! This is where we showcase code that our amazing community is building.

There are two ways to interact with this project:

## [Submit a Code Exchange project](https://github.com/temporal-community/code-exchange/issues/new?template=code-exchange-submission.md)

This is the option for folks who have built things like:

* A demo / example application showcasing Temporal in action for a given use case
* A Temporal "helper application" which helps folks using Temporal get more out of it
* Integrations between Temporal and other tools / platforms
* Other helpful code-oriented things!

Please use this form and one of our handy-dandy review team members will take a look and get it added!

Hint: If you're looking for inspiration, see the list of [open wishlist items](https://github.com/temporal-community/code-exchange/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22code%20exchange%20request%22).

## [Request a Code Exchange project](https://github.com/temporal-community/code-exchange/issues/new?template=code-exchange-wishlist.md)

This is options for folks who aren't finding what they're looking for in our Code Exchange directory, and would like to request it.

* Use cases that are missing?
* Integrations that we don't have yet?
* Pain point with Temporal that you'd love to see someone solve with code?

Please add it here!

# FAQs

## Where can I go to talk about my submission / get feedback on my idea?
Come find us on [Temporal Community Slack](https://t.mp/slack) in the #contributing channel!

## What if I find a bug with one of the projects listed in Code Exchange?
You should report those to the project's repository, not here. :)

## How is this the same as / different from the Awesome Temporal project?

[Awesome Temporal](https://github.com/temporalio/awesome-temporal) falls under the wider [awesome list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/awesome.md) initiaitve, which all follow a similar format of bulleted lists and headings of a curated list of "awesome" resources related to a given topic.

Code Exchange is different, because it is a "first-class" part of Temporal's website (vs. something off to the side), and is specifically designed to bring attention to not only the awesome projects within it, but also (and importantly!) the _community contributors_ behind those projects. ðŸ’–

For now we are keeping both projects around since they both serve a distinct purpose, but they're both intended to showcase the "best of" things that the Temporal ecosystem has to offer.
