# Temporal Code Exchange

Welcome to the accompanying repo to Temporal's [Code Exchange](https://temporal.io/code-exchange), where we showcase awesome code that our amazing community is building.

There are two ways to interact with this project:

## [Submit a Code Exchange project](https://github.com/temporal-community/code-exchange/issues/new?template=code-exchange-submission.yml)

This is the option for folks who have built things like:

* A demo / example application showcasing Temporal in action for a given use case
* A Temporal "helper application" which helps folks using Temporal get more out of it
* Integrations between Temporal and other tools / platforms
* Other helpful code-oriented things!

Please use this form and one of our handy-dandy review team members will take a look and get it added!

Hint: If you're looking for inspiration, see the list of [open suggestions](https://github.com/temporal-community/code-exchange/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22code%20exchange%20suggestion%22).

## [Suggest a Code Exchange project](https://github.com/temporal-community/code-exchange/issues/new?template=code-exchange-suggestion.yml)

This is options for folks who aren't finding what they're looking for in our [Code Exchange](https://temporal.io/code-exchange) directory, and would like to suggest it.

* Use cases that are missing?
* Integrations that we don't have yet?
* Pain point with Temporal that you'd love to see someone solve with code?

Please add it here!

## Criteria for Acceptance
Our trusty Community team reviews submission entries on a ~bi-weekly basis. This process is still brand new, and we'll be nailing down more particulars as we go. However, in general, we will be checking the following:

* Is this entry genuinely _useful_ to Temporal users?
* Are the benefits of the project clearly explained?
* Is it released under an [OSI Approved License](https://opensource.org/licenses)? (if in doubt, Temporal itself uses [MIT](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/main/LICENSE))
* Do the instructions in the README actually work? ;-)

If you have questions, come find us on [Temporal Community Slack](https://t.mp/slack) in the #contributing channel!

# FAQs

## What if I find a bug with one of the projects listed in Code Exchange?
You should report those to the project's repository, not here. :)

## How is this project the same as / different from the Awesome Temporal project?

[Awesome Temporal](https://github.com/temporalio/awesome-temporal) falls under the wider [awesome list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/awesome.md) initiative, which all follow a similar format of bulleted lists and headings of a curated list of "awesome" resources related to a given topic.

Code Exchange is different, because it is a "first-class" part of Temporal's website (vs. something off to the side), and is specifically designed to bring attention to not only the awesome projects within it, but also (and importantly!) the _community contributors_ behind those projects. ðŸ’–

For now we are keeping both projects around since they both serve a distinct purpose, but they're both intended to showcase the "best of" things that the Temporal ecosystem has to offer.
